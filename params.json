{"name":"TwelveMonkeys ImageIO","tagline":"TwelveMonkeys ImageIO: Additional plug-ins and extensions for Java's ImageIO","body":"## Background\r\n\r\nTwelveMonkeys ImageIO is a collection of plug-ins for Java's ImageIO.\r\n\r\nThese plugins extends the number of image file formats supported in Java, using the javax.imageio.* package.\r\nThe main purpose of this project is to provide support for formats not covered by the JDK itself.\r\n\r\nSupport for formats is important, both to be able to read data found\r\n\"in the wild\", as well as to maintain access to data in legacy formats.\r\nBecause there is lots of legacy data out there, we see the need for open implementations of readers for popular formats.\r\nThe goal is to create a set of efficient and robust ImageIO plug-ins, that can be distributed independently.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nMainstream format support\r\n\r\n#### JPEG\r\n\r\n* Read support for the following JPEG flavors:\r\n  * YCbCr JPEGs without JFIF segment (converted to RGB, using embedded ICC profile)\r\n  * CMYK JPEGs (converted to RGB by default or as CMYK, using embedded ICC profile )\r\n  * Adobe YCCK JPEGs (converted to RGB by default or as CMYK, using embedded ICC profile)\r\n  * JPEGs containing ICC profiles with interpretation other than 'Perceptual'\r\n  * JPEGs containing ICC profiles with class other than 'Display'\r\n  * JPEGs containing ICC profiles that are incompatible with stream data\r\n  * JPEGs with corrupted ICC profiles\r\n  * JPEGs with corrupted `ICC_PROFILE` segments\r\n  * JPEGs using non-standard color spaces, unsupported by Java 2D\r\n  * Issues warnings instead of throwing exceptions in cases of corrupted or non-conformant data where ever the image data can still be read in a reasonable way\r\n* Thumbnail support:\r\n  * JFIF thumbnails (even if stream contains inconsistent metadata)\r\n  * JFXX thumbnails (JPEG, Indexed and RGB)\r\n  * EXIF thumbnails (JPEG, RGB and YCbCr)\r\n* Metadata support:\r\n  * JPEG metadata in both standard and native formats (even if stream contains inconsistent metadata)\r\n  * `javax_imageio_jpeg_image_1.0` format (currently as native format, may change in the future)\r\n  * Illegal combinations of JFIF, Exif and Adobe markers, using \"unknown\" segments in the\r\n   \"MarkerSequence\" tag for the unsupported segments (for `javax_imageio_jpeg_image_1.0` format)\r\n* Extended write support in progress:\r\n  * CMYK JPEGs\r\n  * YCCK JPEGs\r\n\r\n#### JPEG-2000\r\n\r\n* Possibly coming in the future, pending some license issues.\r\n\r\nIf you are one of the authors, or know one of the authors and/or the current license holders of either the original jj2000 package or the JAI ImageIO project, please contact me\r\n(I've tried to get in touch in various ways, without success so far).\r\n\r\n#### NetPBM Portable Any Map (PNM) *3.1*\r\n\r\n* Read support for the following file types:\r\n  * PBM in 'P1' (ASCII) and 'P4'

ImageIO.read(file);\r\n\r\nThis will load the first image of the file, entirely into memory.\r\n\r\nThe basic and simplest form of writing is:\r\n\r\n    if (!ImageIO.write(image, format, file)) {\r\n       // Handle image not written case\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis will write the entire image into a single file, using the default settings for the given format.\r\n\r\nThe plugins are discovered automatically at run time. See the [FAQ](#faq) for more info on how this mechanism works.\r\n\r\n## Advanced usage\r\n\r\nIf you need more control of read parameters and the reading process, the common idiom for reading is something like:\r\n\r\n    // Create input stream\r\n    ImageInputStream input = ImageIO.createImageInputStream(file);\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        // Get the reader\r\n        Iterator<ImageReader> readers = ImageIO.getImageReaders(input);\r\n\r\n        if (!readers.hasNext()) {\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"No reader for: \" + file);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        ImageReader reader = readers.next();\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            reader.setInput(input);\r\n\r\n            // Optionally, listen for read warnings, progress, etc.\r\n            reader.addIIOReadWarningListener(...);\r\n            reader.addIIOReadProgressListener(...);\r\n\r\n            ImageReadParam param = reader.getDefaultReadParam();\r\n\r\n            // Optionally, control read settings like sub sampling, source region or destination etc.\r\n            param.setSourceSubsampling(...);\r\n            param.setSourceRegion(...);\r\n            param.setDestination(...);\r\n            // ...\r\n\r\n            // Finally read the image, using settings from param\r\n            BufferedImage image = reader.read(0, param);\r\n\r\n            // Optionally, read thumbnails, meta data, etc...\r\n            int numThumbs = reader.getNumThumbnails(0);\r\n            // ...\r\n        }\r\n        finally {\r\n            // Dispose reader in finally block to avoid memory leaks\r\n            reader.dispose();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    finally {\r\n        // Close stream in finally block to avoid resource leaks\r\n        input.close();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nQuery the reader for source image dimensions using `reader.getWidth(n)` and `reader.getHeight(n)` without reading the\r\nentire image into memory first.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to read multiple images from the same file in a loop, using `reader.getNumImages()`.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need more control of write parameters and the writing process, the common idiom for writing is something like:\r\n\r\n    // Get the writer\r\n    Iterator<ImageWriter> writers = ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName(format);\r\n\r\n    if (!writers.hasNext()) {\r\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"No writer for: \" + format);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ImageWriter writer = writers.next();\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        // Create output stream\r\n        ImageOutputStream output = ImageIO.createImageOutputStream(file);\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            writer.setOutput(output);\r\n\r\n            // Optionally, listen to progress, warnings, etc.\r\n\r\n            ImageWriteParam param = writer.getDefaultWriteParam();\r\n\r\n            // Optionally, control format specific settings of param (requires casting), or\r\n            // control generic write settings like sub sampling, source region, output type etc.\r\n\r\n            // Optionally, provide thumbnails and image/stream metadata\r\n            writer.write(..., new IIOImage(..., image, ...), param);\r\n        }\r\n        finally {\r\n            // Close stream in finally block to avoid resource leaks\r\n            output.close();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    finally {\r\n        // Dispose writer in finally block to avoid memory leaks\r\n        writer.dispose();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor more advanced usage, and information on how to use the ImageIO API, I suggest you read the\r\n[Java Image I/O API Guide](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/imageio/spec/imageio_guideTOC.fm.html)\r\nfrom Oracle.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Deploying the plugins in a web app\r\n\r\nBecause the `ImageIO` plugin registry (the `IIORegistry`) is \"VM global\", it doesn't by default work well with\r\nservlet contexts. This is especially evident if you load plugins from the `WEB-INF/lib` or `classes` folder.\r\nUnless you add `ImageIO.scanForPlugins()` somewhere in your code, the plugins might never be available at all.\r\n\r\nI addition, servlet contexts dynamically loads and unloads classes (using a new class loader per context).\r\nIf you restart your application, old classes will by default remain in memory forever (because the next time\r\n`scanForPlugins` is called, it's another `ClassLoader` that scans/loads classes, and thus they will be new instances\r\nin the registry). If a read is attempted using one of the remaining (\"old\") readers, weird exceptions\r\n(like `NullPointerException`s when accessing `static final` initialized fields) may occur.\r\n\r\nTo work around both the discovery problem and the resource leak,\r\nit is recommended to use the `IIOProviderContextListener` that implements\r\ndynamic loading and unloading of ImageIO plugins for web applications.\r\n\r\n    <web-app ...>\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n        <listener>\r\n            <display-name>ImageIO service provider loader/unloader</display-name>\r\n            <listener-class>com.twelvemonkeys.servlet.image.IIOProviderContextListener</listener-class>\r\n        </listener>\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    </web-app>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Using the ResampleOp\r\n\r\nThe library comes with a resampling (image resizing) operation, that contains many different algorithms\r\nto provide excellent results at reasonable speed.\r\n\r\n    import com.twelvemonkeys.image.ResampleOp;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    BufferedImage input = ...; // Image to resample\r\n    int width, height = ...; // new width/height\r\n\r\n    BufferedImageOp resampler = new ResampleOp(width, height, ResampleOp.FILTER_LANCZOS); // A good default filter, see class documentation for more info\r\n    BufferedImage output = resampler.filter(input, null);\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Using the DiffusionDither\r\n\r\nThe library comes with a dithering operation, that can be used to convert `BufferedImage`s to `IndexColorModel` using\r\nFloyd-Steinberg error-diffusion dither.\r\n\r\n    import com.twelvemonkeys.image.DiffusionDither;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    BufferedImage input = ...; // Image to dither\r\n\r\n    BufferedImageOp ditherer = new DiffusionDither();\r\n    BufferedImage output = ditherer.filter(input, null);\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nDownload the project (using [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)):\r\n\r\n    $ git clone git@github.com:haraldk/TwelveMonkeys.git\r\n\r\nThis should create a folder named `TwelveMonkeys` in your current directory. Change directory to the `TwelveMonkeys`\r\nfolder, and issue the command below to build.\r\n\r\nBuild the project (using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)):\r\n\r\n    $ mvn package\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only supported JDK for making a build is Oracle JDK 7.x. \r\n\r\nIt's possible to build using OpenJDK, but some tests will fail due to some minor differences between the color management systems used. You will need to either disable the tests in question, or build without tests altogether. To build using JDK 8, you need to pass `-Dsun.java2d.cmm=sun.java2d.cmm.kcms.KcmsServiceProvider` to revert to the color manangement system used in Java 7.\r\n\r\nBecause the unit tests needs quite a bit of memory to run, you might have to set the environment variable `MAVEN_OPTS`\r\nto give the Java process that runs Maven more memory. I suggest something like `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m`.\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can install the project in your local Maven repository using:\r\n\r\n    $ mvn install\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nTo install the plug-ins,\r\neither use Maven and add the necessary dependencies to your project,\r\nor manually add the needed JARs along with required dependencies in class-path.\r\n\r\nThe ImageIO registry and service lookup mechanism will make sure the plugins are available for use.\r\n\r\nTo verify that the JPEG plugin is installed and used at run-time, you could use the following code:\r\n\r\n    Iterator<ImageReader> readers = ImageIO.getImageReadersByFormatName(\"JPEG\");\r\n    while (readers.hasNext()) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"reader: \" + readers.next());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe first line should print:\r\n\r\n    reader: com.twelvemonkeys.imageio.jpeg.JPEGImageReader@somehash\r\n\r\n#### Maven dependency example\r\n\r\nTo depend on the JPEG and TIFF plugin using Maven, add the following to your POM:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    <dependencies>\r\n        ...\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.twelvemonkeys.imageio</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>imageio-jpeg</artifactId>\r\n            <version>3.0.2</version> <!-- Alternatively, build your own version -->\r\n        </dependency>\r\n        <dependency>\r\n

See the Install section above.\r\n\r\n\r\nq: What changes do I have to make to my code in order to use the plug-ins?\r\n\r\na: The short answer is: None. For basic usage, like ImageIO.read(...) or ImageIO.getImageReaders(...), there is no need\r\nto change your code. Most of the functionality is available through standard ImageIO APIs, and great care has been taken\r\n not to introduce extra API where none is necessary.\r\n\r\nShould you want to use very specific/advanced features of some of the formats, you might have to use specific APIs, like\r\n   setting base URL for an SVG image that consists of multiple files,\r\n   or controlling the output compression of a TIFF file.\r\n\r\n\r\nq: How does it work?\r\n\r\na: The TwelveMonkeys ImageIO project contains plug-ins for ImageIO. ImageIO uses a service lookup mechanism, to discover plug-ins at runtime. \r\n\r\nAll you have have to do, is to make sure you have the TwelveMonkeys JARs in your classpath.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the registry and the lookup mechanism in the [IIORegistry API doc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/imageio/spi/IIORegistry.html).\r\n\r\nThe fine print: The TwelveMonkeys service providers for TIFF and JPEG overrides the onRegistration method, and\r\nutilizes the pairwise partial ordering mechanism of the IIOServiceRegistry to make sure it is installed before\r\nthe Sun/Oracle provided JPEGImageReader and the Apple provided TIFFImageReader on OS X, respectively.\r\nUsing the pairwise ordering will not remove any functionality form these implementations, but in most cases you'll end\r\nup using the TwelveMonkeys plug-ins instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nq: What about JAI? Several of the formats are already supported by JAI.\r\n\r\na: While JAI (and jai-imageio in particular) have support for some of the formats, JAI has some major issues.\r\nThe most obvious being:\r\n- It's not actively developed. No issues has been fixed for years.\r\n- To get full format support, you need native libs.\r\nNative libs does not exist for several popular platforms/architectures, and further the native libs are not open source.\r\nSome environments may also prevent deployment of native libs, which brings us back to square one.\r\n\r\n\r\nq: What about JMagick or IM4Java? Can't you just use what´s already available?\r\n\r\na: While great libraries with a wide range of formats support, the ImageMagick-based libraries has some disadvantages\r\ncompared to ImageIO.\r\n- No real stream support, these libraries only work with files.\r\n- No easy access to pixel data through standard Java2D/BufferedImage API.\r\n- Not a pure Java solution, requires system specific native libs.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe did it\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
