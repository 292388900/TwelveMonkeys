- These readers/writers could probably benefit alot from using JNI with nio
    bytechannel buffers... RFE to JMagick guys?
- Create stream providers and allow creatig a ImageInputStream from a
    MagickImage? Does that even make sense? Or maybe create File based streams
    that exposes the file name for JMagick to write directly.
